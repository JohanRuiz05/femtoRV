## How it works

This SoC development is based on the FemtoRV32 project, which encompasses the RISC-V core known as Quark. The single-cycle microarchitecture of Quark, consisting of fetch, decode, register read, execute, and write-back stages, stands out for its minimalist and compact structure. With the assistance of open-source tools, as OpenLane and Magic, this is a femtoRV implememtation using SPI flasg and spiRAM.

## How to test

The project use the open-source tool Xyce to test the analog circuit design of the top module (femto.v), obtained from the SPICE model of the verilog files extracted with Magic. In this way, the signals required to ensure the processor's operation were verified, particularly in terms of the SPI memory and the UART peripheral.Then, you must program an external flash memory with desired application, all communication and debug messages are displayed in UART

## External hardware

The project only uses a LED display (output) as external hardware.
